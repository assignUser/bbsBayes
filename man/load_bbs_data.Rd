\title{Load Breeding Bird Survey dataset into R Session (TIDY)}
\usage{
load_bbs_data(level = "state", release = 2022, sample = FALSE, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{level}{Character. Either "state" or "stop", specifying which counts to
load. Defaults to "state", which provides counts beginning in 1966,
aggregated in five bins, each of which contains cumulative counts from 10 of
the 50 stops along a route. Specifying "stop" provides stop-level data
beginning in 1997, which includes counts for each stop along routes
individually. Note that stop-level data is not currently supported by
the modelling utilities in bbsBayes.}

\item{quiet}{}
}
\value{
Large list (3 elements) consisting of:
\item{birds}{Data frame of sample bird point count data per route, per year}
\item{routes}{Data frame of sample yearly route data}
\item{species}{Sample list of North American bird species}
}
\description{
Loads the raw, unstratified BBS data into the current R session.
The data must have been previously fetched using \code{fetch_bbs_data()}.
Note that this is not necessary to run a Bayesian analysis of BBS data;
calling \code{stratify()} will do the loading for you.
